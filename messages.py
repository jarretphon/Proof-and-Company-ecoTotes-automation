            <p>Hello Team,</p>
            <p>Thank you for your continued support in your <span style="color: rgb(84, 130, 53);">ecoSPIRITS</span> Program!</p>
            <p>
                To ensure a steady turnover of ecoTOTES, we have implemented a <strong>3 month Flagging System</strong> for the 
                return of all empty ecoTOTES. Our ecoTOTES are a valuable commodity and their re-use is central to the 
                success of our sustainable distribution program. We appreciate your help in our efforts in recouping 
                them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following below is a report of all the ecoTOTES at your venue that have been with you <strong>for 3 months
                or more.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Please do account for these totes and get back to us confirming either they are:</p>

                Do take note that <u>should we not receive any confirmation about the status of the metioned totes</u> within the next two weeks, we will deem these totes "Missing" and move forward with charging the value of these totes to your account.
